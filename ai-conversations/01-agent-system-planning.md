# Agent System Planning

## Initial Prompt

**User:** "I need to set up an automated development workflow with AI agents for my Weather API project. I want one agent focused on development tasks and another on quality assurance. Can you help me design this system?"

## Claude's Response

**Claude:** "I'll help you create a comprehensive AI agent system for your Weather API project. Based on your requirements, I recommend a two-agent architecture:

### Proposed Architecture:
1. **Claude Dev Agent** - Development automation
2. **Claude QA Agent** - Quality assurance automation
3. **Agent Coordinator** - Orchestration system

### Key Requirements Analysis:
- **Development Agent:** Code scaffolding, feature implementation, API development
- **QA Agent:** Testing, security audits, performance benchmarks
- **Integration:** Seamless workflow between agents
- **Automation:** Executable scripts with proper error handling

Would you like me to start with the development agent configuration?"

## Follow-up Discussion

**User:** "Yes, start with the dev agent. I need it to handle Go API development and SvelteKit frontend components."

**Claude:** "Perfect! I'll create a development agent with these capabilities:

### Dev Agent Core Functions:
1. **Feature Scaffolding** - Create new feature branches and directories
2. **API Endpoint Generation** - Scaffold Go handlers and routes
3. **Component Creation** - Generate SvelteKit components
4. **Build Management** - Compile and build project components
5. **Status Reporting** - Development progress tracking

### Implementation Plan:
- JSON configuration file with agent capabilities
- Bash script with executable commands
- Logging system for tracking activities
- Integration with your existing project structure

Let me start implementing this..."

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Agent Structure:** JSON config + Bash scripts for maximum flexibility
2. **Command Interface:** CLI-based for easy integration with existing workflows
3. **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging and tracking
4. **Coordination:** Central coordinator script for orchestrated workflows
5. **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and validation

## Technical Specifications Agreed Upon

### Dev Agent Commands:
- `new-feature <name>` - Create feature scaffold
- `api-endpoint <name>` - Generate API endpoint
- `component <name>` - Create Svelte component
- `build` - Build project components
- `status` - Show development status

### QA Agent Commands:
- `unit-tests` - Run unit tests with coverage
- `integration-tests` - Run integration tests
- `security-audit` - Perform security scan
- `performance-test` - Run benchmarks
- `validate-api` - Test API contracts
- `full-report` - Generate comprehensive report

## Next Steps Identified

1. Create agent directory structure
2. Implement Dev Agent configuration and scripts
3. Implement QA Agent configuration and scripts
4. Create coordination system
5. Add comprehensive documentation
6. Test entire workflow

## Outcome

Agreed on a comprehensive agent system that provides:
- **Automated Development:** Code generation, building, scaffolding
- **Quality Assurance:** Testing, security, performance validation
- **Orchestration:** Coordinated workflows for common development tasks
- **Documentation:** Complete documentation and examples
