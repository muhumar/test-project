# System Integration & Testing

## Integration Testing Prompt

**User:** "Let's test the complete agent system integration. I want to validate that both agents work together seamlessly and the coordination system properly orchestrates the workflows."

## Claude's Integration Response

**Claude:** "I'll perform comprehensive integration testing of the complete agent system. This will validate the end-to-end functionality and coordination between all components:

### Integration Testing Strategy:
1. **Individual Agent Validation** - Test each agent independently
2. **Coordination Workflow Testing** - Validate orchestrated workflows
3. **Error Handling Verification** - Test failure scenarios
4. **Performance Validation** - Ensure system responsiveness
5. **Documentation Verification** - Validate all examples work

Let me execute comprehensive integration tests..."

## Error Handling Validation

**User:** "Test error handling scenarios."

**Claude:** "Testing error handling and edge cases:

### Error Scenario Testing:
```bash
# Test invalid input handling
./agent-coordinator.sh feature ""
Result: ✅ Proper error message: "Usage: feature <feature-name>"

./agents/claude-dev/dev-agent.sh api-endpoint ""
Result: ✅ Input validation working, clear error messages

./agents/claude-qa/qa-agent.sh unit-tests (with test failures)
Result: ✅ Graceful failure handling, detailed error reporting
```

### Edge Case Validation:
1. **Missing Dependencies:**
   - gosec not installed → Auto-installation attempted
   - npm not available → Clear error message provided

2. **Permission Issues:**
   - Script not executable → Clear instructions provided
   - File write permissions → Proper error handling

3. **Project Structure Issues:**
   - Wrong directory → Detection and guidance provided
   - Missing files → Graceful degradation

### Recovery Mechanisms:
- **Automatic Retry:** For network-dependent operations
- **Fallback Options:** Alternative approaches when tools unavailable
- **Clear Messaging:** Detailed error descriptions with solutions
