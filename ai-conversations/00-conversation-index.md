# AI Conversations Index - Agent System Development

Complete development process of creating a two-agent AI system for automated development workflows, including comprehensive testing, security auditing, and quality assurance.

## ðŸ¤– Core Agent Creation Prompt

**Master Prompt Used:**
> "Create two specialized AI agents: (1) Dev Agent for code scaffolding, feature implementation, API development, and building with executable bash scripts and JSON configs, (2) QA Agent for comprehensive testing, security audits, performance benchmarks, and quality reports with automated test generation. Include an Agent Coordinator script that orchestrates workflows between both agents. Each agent needs: configuration JSON with roles/capabilities, executable shell script with 5-6 core commands, logging system, and integration with project structure. Provide complete file structure, example commands, and coordination workflows for feature development, API creation, full dev cycles, and pre-deployment validation. Make everything executable and production-ready with proper error handling and comprehensive documentation."
